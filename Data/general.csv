The National Financial Reporting Authority NFRA is the most recent of inclusions as an overseer of auditing profession and accounting standards in India. Other important regulators include Ministry of Corporate Affairs MCA It administers the Companies Act, 2013. MCA articulates the governments view on financial reporting and accounting requirements. Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI They are responsible for the regulation of the companies listed on the stock exchanges in India. SEBI prescribes the type and amount of information provided in company prospectuses for the issue of securities. SEBI introduced Cash Flow Statements. Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ICAI ICAI has been holding an advisory role to the government on accounting and auditing but lately it has been relieved of duty in this context. They mainly regulate Chartered Accountants.

The purpose of GAAP is to create a uniform standard for financial reporting. The primary purpose of financial information is to help investors and other stakeholders to make important decisions with the right knowledge at their disposal. They should be able to easily assess the financial position of the company before decision making.

84 Why is the periodic income measurement necessary?,"Business activity is expected to perpetual and continuous. But, for purposes of measuring performance, it is necessary to draw a line in the sand of time. A periodicity assumption is made that business activity can be divided into measurement intervals, such as months, quarters, and years. A periodicity assumption helps to draw a line in the sand and also helps to gauge the performance of the business. It is important to assign revenues and expenses appropriately to their respective time periods for accurate presentation of financial statements. This works in favor of all the stakeholders in the business since the periodicity concept helps in proper determination and allocation of transactions to the right time period. Correctly assigning revenues and expenses to time periods is pivotal in the determination of income. It goes without saying that reported income is of great concern to investors and creditors, and its proper determination is crucial. Measurement issues can become complex. The following explanation helps simplify the concept. Why would companies try and get their financial statements prepared at regular intervals instead of employing"
resources to engage in their business operations? Had it not been an important principle,would the company really use the periodicity concept of measurement of its
transactions? The answer is YES. Periodicity assumption doesnt just help provide,intervals for recording transactions it becomes useful for investors to understand how the business is functioning and also the managers to look for areas to improve. A business without periodicity is more like students without examinations. Both feel they are better off without the former to add to their responsibility but we know what is best for them.
5 What is the money measurement assumption?,The money measurement concept states that a business is to record every such event or transaction that can be measured in terms of money. Those transactions which cannot be expressed in monetary terms is not recorded in the monetary terms. This implies that all transactions that can be seen as quantified information come under the purview of this assumption.
realistic is the money measurement assumption?,"The qualitative aspects of the business failed to be considered often due to the limitation of the scope of this concept. A lot of companies boast of their qualitative USPs and for some, it is abundantly clear but they cannot be recorded in accounting simply because they cannot be quantified. A few of such exemptions are a competent workforce, employee working conditions, product durability, expected resale value of a patent, quality customer support or field service, and many more. There are not many accounting tools to accurately quantify most of the transactions stated above. Although some companies boast of these traits and are known to have such characteristics, it is not measurable. Hence, it is a common notion that the money measurement concept is less realistic and its relevance is restricted to a certain extent. 7 What are the underlying Assumptions for preparation and presentation"
of Financial Statements?,"Separate Reporting Entity It is the subject of set of financial statements. Accountants treat a business as separate from its owners and other related firms. The reporting entity defines the scope of the activities to be included in the financial statements. It may be i a business, ii a legal entity, iii a group or iv a segment. Going Concern The financial statements are normally prepared on the assumption that an entity is a going concern and will continue in operation for the foreseeable future. Hence, it is assumed that the entity has neither the intention nor the need to liquidate or curtail materially the scale of its operations if such an intention or need exists, the financial statements may have to be prepared on a different basis and, if so, the basis used is disclosed. Accrual Basis In order to meet their objectives, financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting. Under this basis, the effects of transactions and other events are recognised when they occur and not as cash or its equivalent is received or paid."
108 What are the qualitative characteristics of Financial Statements?,"a Understandability An essential quality of the information provided in financial statements is that it is readily understandable by users. b Relevance To be useful, information must be relevant to the decisionmaking needs of users. Materiality The relevance of information is affected by its nature and materiality. Information is material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. c Reliability To be useful, information must also be reliable. Information has the quality of reliability when it is free from material error and bias and can be depended upon by users to represent faithfully that which it either purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent. i. Faithful representation To be reliable, information must represent faithfully the transactions and other events it either purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent. ii. Substance over form If information is to represent faithfully the transactions and other events that it purports to represent, it is necessary that they are accounted for and presented in accordance with their substance and economic reality and not merely their legal form. iii. Neutrality To be reliable, the information contained in financial statements must be neutral, that is, free from bias. Prudence Prudence is the inclusion of a degree of caution in the exercise of the judgements needed in making the estimates required under conditions of uncertainty, such that assets or income are not overstated and liabilities or expenses are not understated. iv. Completeness To be reliable, the information in financial statements must be complete within the bounds of materiality and cost. An omission can cause information to be false or misleading and thus unreliable and deficient in terms of its relevance. d Comparability Users must be able to compare the financial statements of an entity through time in order to identify trends in its financial position and performance. Users must also be able to compare the financial statements of different entities in order to evaluate their relative financial position, performance and cash flows."

1 What is the Cash system of Accounting?,"Cash accounting is a methodology under which transactions are recorded only when cash moves in or moves out. For example, income will be recorded when a firm receives cash, and expenses are recorded when cash is paid by the firm."
2 What are the Benefits of cash accounting?,It is beneficial for small companies and for companies that have complex organizational structures accrual accounting is better. It is fairly easy to use cash system methodology because cash accounting is a system where revenues as well as expenses are realized when they are received or paid out in case of an expense.

This accrual is a type of expense that has not yet been recorded by a company as an expense but has been paid in advance. On the other side, it is recorded in the balance sheet prepaid expenses are first recorded as an asset. After the benefits of the assets are realized over time, the amount is then recorded as an expense. 132.

5 What is the Income measurement principle?,"Realization principle According to the recognition or realization principle revenue is recognized when they are realized, realizable, and are earned. Now revenue is the cash inflow for a business arising from the different sale of goods or services. And we assume that this revenue is realized only when it legally arises to be received. So, in simpler terms, the profit earned will be recorded when it is actually earned. Matching principle The matching principle states that the related revenues and expenses must be matched in the same period. This is done in order to link the costs of an asset or revenue to its benefits. In practice, the matching principle combines accrual accounting wherein revenues and expenses are recorded as they are incurred, no matter when cash is received with the revenue recognition principle which states that revenues should be recognized when they are earned or realized, no matter when cash is received."
146 How does the Income measurement mechanism work?,"Accrual When transactions are recorded in the books of accounts as they occur even if the payment for that particular product or service has not been received or made, it is known as accrualbased accounting. This method is more appropriate in assessing the health of the organization in financial terms. Accrual refers to an entry made in the books of accounts related to the recording of revenue or expense paid without any exchange of cash. The use of accrual accounting is typically useful in businesses where there are a lot of credit transactions or the goods and services are sold on credit, which simply means that there was no exchange of cash. Deferrals Deferral accounts for expenses that have been prepaid or early receipt of revenues. In other words, it is the payment made or payment received for products or services not yet provided.

1610 Describe the adjusting process of depreciation?,"Depreciation Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. It is allocating the cost of an asset to the periods that are expected to benefit from the assets use and gradual conversion of cost into the expense. It is necessary to charge depreciation even if the market value of an asset has appreciated because depreciation is a process of cost allocation, not asset valuation. It continues even when the asset becomes idle or is retired from active use unless the asset is fully depreciated. Example if a 150,000 rupees car with a 3year life was purchased and depreciation expense would be rupees 50,000 per year then 150,0003 50,000. This expense of 50,000 rupees would be reported on each years income statement. The journal entry of the expense is enumerated below Particulars Dr. Amount Cr Amount Depreciation Expense Ac 50,000 To Accumulated Depreciation AC 50,000 Steps to find depreciation Recognition of Depreciable Asset Establishing the depreciable amount Estimating the useful life Choosing an appropriate cost allocation method Step1 Recognition of Depreciable Asset Step2Establishing the depreciable amount Step3Estimating the useful life Step4Choosing an appropriate cost allocation method There are three methods which are enumerated below Straightline method SLM Writtendownvalue WDV method ProductionUnits method"

In India, the accounting period is for one year starting from 1st April of the current calendar year to 31st March of the next calendar year. Historical cost concept According to this concept, the value of an asset should be recorded on the basis of historical costamount at which the asset was acquired or purchased cost of acquisition of an asset.

Income statement The income statement of an organization or business entity is the financial statement that contains financial information about the three important components, which are revenues, profit or loss, and expenses incurred during the accounting period. 24It is sometimes called as the statement of financial position performance as this statement helps users of financial information in determining the financial performance of an organization from one accounting period to another of the same business or with that of the competitors. The three components of the income statement are explained as follows Revenues It refers to the sales of goods and services that the business generates during the current accounting period. Revenues can be obtained from both cash and credit sales. Profit or Loss Profit or loss is the net income which is obtained by deducting the expenses from the revenues. Profit will happen if revenues are more than expenses and loss will occur if expenses are more than revenue. Expenses Expenses are the cost of operations that an organization incurs for running day to day operations. They can be administrative expenses like salaries, depreciation, etc. II. Balance sheet A balance sheet is known as a statement of financial position as it shows the position of assets, liabilities, and equity at the end of an accounting period. The net worth of a business can be determined by deducting the liabilities from the assets. If the users of financial information are looking for information regarding the financial position of the company, a balance sheet is the most appropriate statement which will present the necessary information. Components of a balance sheet are assets, liabilities, and equity. These are described below A Assets Assets are resources that are owned by the company both legally and economically. There are two main classes of assets. They are current and noncurrent assets. Current assets are shortterm assets that can be converted in the current accounting period, and these include cash in hand, raw materials, petty cash, etc. Noncurrent assets comprise tangible and intangible assets, and these include machinery, building, land, computer equipment, vehicles, etc. Assets are equal to the sum of liabilities and equity of the organization. 25B Liabilities Liabilities are obligations of a company which they owe to other businesses or individuals. It includes interests payable, loans, taxes, etc. Liabilities are of two categories current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities. Current liabilities are due within a year that means the organization has to pay the dues within that accounting year only. Noncurrent liabilities, on the other hand, are obligations that have a longer period of repayment, which is more than twelve months. For example, a longterm lease whi is due in more than twelve months. C Equity Equity is defined as the difference between assets and liabilities. The examples of equity are retained earnings, share capital. Equity can be calculated by subtracting assets from liabilities. III. Statement of changes in equity This type of financial statement shows the contributions of shareholders, the movement of equity, and the balance of equity at the end of an accounting period. It shows all the changes in equity that take place during the accounting period. It includes the issue or purchase of shares, issuing of dividends, etc. IV. Statement of Cash Flow The cash flow statement reveals the movement of cash in an organization. It comprises cash inflows and outflows. Cash flow can be classified into three activities which are operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. V. Notes to financial statements This is the fifth type of statement that is"

3 COMPONENTS OF SHAREHOLDER EQUITY?,"Shareholders equity is the amount of money a company could return to shareholders if all its assets were converted to cash and all its debts were paid off. The things which are included in shareholders equity. Authorised Capital Authorised capital is the amount of the share capital in which a company is allowed to issue its Memorandum of Association. The company is not supposed to raise more than the amount of capital as mentioned in the Memorandum of Association. It is also known as Registered or Nominal capital. The authorised capital can be either decreased or increased as per the process furnished in the Companies Act. It should be understood that the company need not issue the complete authorised capital for public subscription at one time. Relying upon its necessity, it may circulate share capital but, in any scenario, it should not cross more than the amount of authorised capital. Issued Capital It is that portion of the authorised capital which is usually circulated to the public for subscription comprising the shares assigned to the merchants and the endorsers to the enterprises memorandum. The authorised capital which is not proffered for public consent is called as unissued capital. 27 Subscribed Capital It is that chunk of the issued capital which is subscribed and contributed by the public. When the shares offered for public subscription are contributed entirely by the public, however, subscribed capital and the issued capital would be similar. Ultimately, the issued capital and subscribed capital are similar because if the total number of shares that is subscribed is less than what is offered, the company allocate only those number of shares for which the subscription has been received. Called up Capital It is that chunk of the subscribed capital which is called upon the shares. The company may ascertain to call the complete amount or just a chunk of the shares face value. Outstanding Shares The number of outstanding shares is an integral part of shareholders equity. It is the amount of company stock that has been sold to investors and not repurchased by the company. It represents the total amount of stock the company has issued to public investors, company officers, and company insiders, including restricted shares. Additional Paidin Capital Shareholders equity also includes the amount of money paid for shares of stock above the stated par value, known as additional paidin capital APIC. This figure is derived from the difference between the par value of common and preferred stock and the price each has sold for, as well as shares that were newly sold. Retained Earnings When a company retains income instead of paying it out as a dividend to stockholders, a positive balance in the companys retained earnings account is created. A company often uses retained earnings to pay off debt or reinvest in the business. This figure is included in shareholders equity and is typically the largest line item in this calculation. You can find a companys retained earnings on its balance sheet under shareholders equity or in a separate statement of retained earnings. A company may refer to its retained earnings as its retention ratio or its retained surplus. You want to describe or define free reserves here. 284 WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CURRENT ASSETS VS"
NONCURRENT ASSETS?,"Current Assets Equal to cash or will be converted into cash within a year Used to fund immediate or current needs Items like cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, accounts receivables, inventories Valued at market prices Tax implications Selling current assets results in the profit from trading activities Current assets generally not subject to revaluationthough in certain cases, inventories subject to revaluation give an illustration in the Indian context. USES Current Assets can be used as clear regular payments and bills. It gives an insight into the companys cash and liquid position Investors and Creditors analyse the companys current assets closely to understand the risk or benefits involved in the operation. EXAMPLE Cash and cash equivalent Inventory Prepaid expenses Account receivable Marketable securities Noncurrent Assets Will not be converted into cash within one year Used to fund longterm or future needs Items like long term investments, PPE, goodwill, depreciation and amortization, long term deferred taxes assets Valued at cost less depreciation Tax implications Selling assets results in capital gains and capital gains tax are applied 29 Common revaluation of PPEfor instance, when the market value of a tangible asset decreases compared to the book value, a firm needs to revalue that asset give illustrations in the Indian context Noncurrent assets consist of both tangible assets and intangible assets A. Tangible asset A tangible asset is an asset that has a physical form. Tangible assets include both fixed assets, such as machinery, buildings, and land, and current assets, such as inventory. The opposite of a tangible asset is an intangible asset. Example land and building plant and machinery B. Intangible Assets This asset does not have a physical appearance and can be intellectual properties. It is considered as a noncurrent asset because it cannot be liquidated to cash with 12 months of the investment. Some examples are Patent Trademark Copyright Important things to know how to classify assets Noncurrent assets are categorized on the balance sheet under the heading of investment, property, plant, equipment, intangible assets, etc., The assets are classified according to the segment of the balance sheet Investments are always labelled as a noncurrent asset only if the total expected return is not expected within the next 12 months of the balance sheet Property, plant, land, buildings, and machinery including vehicles are fixed asset Intangible assets are goods that have no physical presence Intangible assets may also arise from the sale or purchase of a business unit"
305 PROVISIONS VS RESERVES?,"Provisions Provisions are charged on profits. The creation of provision does not depend on profit. They have to be created even if there are inadequate profits or heavy losses. They are created to meet a known liability The creation of provision is necessary as per law. Provisions are recorded on the debit side of the Profit and Loss Account. Provision may appear on either side of the balance sheet by way of deduction from the concerned asset or separately on the liabilities side. Provision can never be invested outside the business Provision can never be distributed as profit unless actual liability is less than the amount provided for. Provision reduces net profit. The provision refers to an amount that is kept aside from a companys profit in order to cover probable expenses arising in the future or a possible reduction in the value of an asset. Provisions are important for a business as they address certain expenses in business and payments made for them. Provisions should not be regarded as savings as these are created to meet expenses for an anticipated liability in the future. WHERE RECORDED It appears in the income statement in the form of expenses and is recorded as a current liability in the balance sheet. Example you have a motorcycle that is on the verge of a breakdown. You know about it but use it to ride to work every day. The repair costs are too high for you to make the payment in one go. In this case, you set aside a portion of your allowance salary, towards the hiring of a taxi to go to work or towards the expected sum of repair. When the motorcycle actually breaks down, you have a certain sum of money squirreled away to meet those expenses 31Reserves Reserves are an appropriation of profits. Reserves depend upon profit. In the absence of adequate profits, reserves cannot be created. Reserves are created to strengthen the liquid resources of the business enterprise. Maintenance of reserves is not necessary because they are created as per financial prudence. Reserves a recorded on the debit side of the Profit and Loss Appropriation Account. Reserves are always shown on the liabilities side. Reserves can be invested outside the business and known as the Reserve Fund. Reserves, other than capital reserves, can be distributed as profit. Reserves reduce divisible profits. There are two types of reserves in an organization Capital Reserve Revenue Reserve The capital reserve is created from the capital profits and is not available for distribution to shareholders in the form of dividends. Therefore, it cannot be created from the profits earned from the core operations of a company. Revenue reserve is created from the profits earned from the core operations of a company or organization. A profit and loss appropriation account needs to be made for creating a Revenue reserve. It can be used for the following purposes. Paying dividend to shareholders Expanding the business Stabilizing the dividend rate Further Revenue reserve can be classified as Both general and specific reserves ar created out of profit earned in the normal course of business, yet the following differences are observed between general and specific reserves. 32General Reserve General reserve is created not for a specific purpose. It is created to strengthen the financial position of the business It can be utilized for any purpose. A dividend can be paid out of it if needed. Specific Reserve . It is created for some specific purpose. For example, a debenture sinking fund is created for the purpose of repaying loans on account of the debenture. . It can be utilized only for the purpose for which it has been created. It cannot be utilized for other purposes. . The dividend cannot be paid out of it. But on fulfilment of the objective for which a fund has been created the fund will no longer be required, when dividends may be paid out of it. For example, on repayment of the loan on account of debenture the debenture sinking fund is not required. Then it is transferred to the general reserve fund. In other words, the fund mone is distributable as dividends. Example dividend equalization reserve, investment fluctuation reserves"
WHAT ARE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND TYPES?,"An intangible asset is an asset that is not physical in nature. Goodwill, brand recognition, and intellectual property, such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights, are all intangible assets. Intangible assets exist in opposition to tangible assets, which include land, vehicles, equipment, and inventory. Such an asset is identifiable when it is separable, or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights. Separable assets can be sold, transferred, licensed, etc. Examples of intangible assets include computer software, licences, trademarks, patents, films, copyrights, and import quotas. 33TYPES Goodwill is an intangible asset that is associated with the purchase of one company by another. Specifically, goodwill is the portion of the purchase price that is higher than the sum of the net fair value of all of the assets purchased in the acquisition and the liabilities assumed in the process. The value of a companys brand name, solid customer base, good customer relations, good employee relations, and proprietary technology represents some reasons why goodwill exists. Trademarks The term trademark refers to a recognizable insignia, phrase, word, or symbol that denotes a specific product and legally differentiates it from all other products of its kind. A trademark exclusively identifies a product as belonging to a specific company and recognizes the companys ownership of the brand. Trademarks are generally considered a form of intellectual property and may or may not be registered. Copyrights Copyrights protect original works of authorship, such as writings, art, architecture, and music. For as long as the copyright is in effect, the copyright owner has the sole right to display, share, perform, or license the material. One notable exception is the fair use doctrine, which allows some degree of distribution of copyrighted material for scholarly, educational or newsreporting purposes. Patents A patent safeguards an original invention for a certain period of time and is gran by the United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO. By granting the right to produce a product without fear of competition for the duration of the patent, an incentive is provided for companies or individuals to continue developing innovative new products or services."
WHAT IS INVESTMENT PROPERTY?,"An investment property is real estate property purchased with the intention of earning a return on the investment either through rental income, the future resale of the property, or both. The property may be held by an individual investor, a group of investors, or a corporation. An investment property can be a longterm endeavour or a shortterm investment. With the latter, investors will often engage in flipping, where real estate is bought, remodelled or renovated, and sold at a profit within a short time frame. 34The term investment property may also be used to describe other assets an investor purchases for the sake of future appreciation such as art, securities, land, or other collectibles. Types Residential, Commercial, and Mixed The following are examples of investment property a Land held for longterm capital appreciation rather than for shortterm sale in the ordinary course of business. b Land held for a currently undetermined future use. If an entity has not determined that it will use the land as owneroccupied property or for short term sale in the ordinary course of business, the land is regarded as held for capital appreciation. c A building owned by the entity or a rightofuse asset relating to a building held by the entity and leased out under one or more operating leases. d A building that is vacant but is held to be leased out under one or more operating leases. e Property that is being constructed or developed for future use as an investment property. The following are examples of items that are not investment property and are therefore outside the scope of this Standard a property intended for sale in the ordinary course of business or in the process of construction or development for such sale see Ind AS 2, Inventories, for example, property acquired exclusively with a view to subsequent disposal in the near future or for development and resale. b owneroccupied property see Ind AS 16 and Ind AS 116, including property held for future use as owneroccupied property, property held for future development and subsequent use as owneroccupied property, property occupied by employees whether or not the employees pay rent at market rates and owneroccupied property awaiting disposal. c property leased to another entity under a finance lease. 35Measuring and Reporting of Inventories BY ADITYA SINGH"
What are Inventory and its types?,"Indian Accounting Standard 2Ind AS 2 defines inventories as assets which are held for the sale in the normal course of business, in the process of production for such sale, or in the form of supplies or material to be consumed in the production process or rendering of services Ind AS 2 doesnt allow for the capitalization of the abnormal cost of waste, storage costs where the storage is not part of the production process, administrative costs, selling costs. Inventory refers to all those goods that are in different stages of the production process including Finished goods available for sale Work in process in the of being made Raw materials processed to make the final product Precisely, Inventory is referring to goods available for sale and raw materials which are the process to make finished goods. Types of inventory Raw material Raw materials consist of all the items which are processed to make the final product. For example, the Flour is the raw material for the company producing Pizza and Crude Oil is the raw material for an oil refinery. 36Work in progress WIP Work in progress is also commonly known as semifinished goods. Raw Materials have been undergoing the process of their conversion into the final goods or products. Which are partly processed or have not been converted into the final good or product than this stage is known as work in progress. For example, in process of making Pizza, the dough of the Flour is work in process. Finished goods Finished goods are the final goods or products that are ready for sale. The goods, which have passed through all stages of production and quality checking. For example, Pizza is the final product for a company that sells pizza."
What do you mean by the Cost of goods sold COGS?,"The cost of inventory comprises all the costs of purchase, costs of conversion, and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition Ind AS 2.10 The cost of goods sold is referred to all the direct expenses incurred to produce the goods or services sold by a company. The direct expense includes material cost, direct labour cost, and direct factory overheads. The cost of goods sold is often the second line item appearing on the income statement. The cost of goods sold does not include selling expenses, general expenses, and administrative expenses such as advertisement expenses and salaries. For the computation of COGS, the opening annual inventory amount, add net purchases and then subtract the closing inventory for the period from that total. COGS Beginning Inventory Net Purchases during the Period Ending Inventory Example XYZ Ltd. has an opening inventory of $8,000, makes purchases valued at $5,000, and is left with  closing inventory of $1,000. Use the COGS formula. COGS Opening Inventory Net Purchases during the Period Closing Inventory 37COGS $8,000 $5,000 $1,000 COGS $12,000"
What Is Gross Profit?,"Gross profit, the profit a company makes after deducting the costs of goods sold and sales return from revenue or total sales revenue. The formula of gross profit is Gross Profit Net sales Sales Revenue Cost of Goods Sold Sales Revenue Sales Revenue or net sales is the monetary amount obtained from selling goods and services to customer minus sales returned allowancesdiscounts. Example A business had sold 100 units of the product, for the revenue of $10,000 and the cost of goods sold was $5,000 for the year, also there was a sales return of $1,000. Calculate the Gross Profit. Gross Profit Net sales COGS Net Sales Sales sales returnallowance Net Sales $10,000 $1,000 $9,000 Gross Profit $9,000 $5,000 $4,000"
What do you mean by goods in transit?,"According to Ind AS 2 Inventories, How and when to determine the Ownership of the Goods 38Goods in Transit At end of the year, any goods which are in transit from the seller to buyer may properly be includable in one and only one, of those parties inventories, based on the terms and conditions of the sale. FOB stands for free on board , If goods are shipped to FOB destination, transportation costs are paid by the seller and the title doesnt pass until the carrier delivers the goods to the buyer, thus these goods are part of the sellers inventory while in transit. In case goods of FOB shipping point, the transportation costs, which are paid by the buyer and title passes when the carrier takes possession, thus these goods are part of the buyers inventory while transiting."
What are the different methods of valuation of inventory?,"International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and Generally Accepted Principles GAAP allow firms to use the following methods of inventory valuation Specific identification, firstin, firstout FIFO, and Weighted average cost. Also, GAAP allows the firms to use an additional method Lastin, firstout LIFO. The Specific Identification Method The Specific identification method is applied for the inventory that isnt generally interchangeable and for goods that have been produced and segregated for specific projects. It is also commonly used for expensive goods that are uniquely identifiable, like precious gemstones. With this method, the cost of sales and the cost of closing inventory reflect the actual costs incurred to purchase or manufacture the items specifically identified as sold and the items specifically identified as remaining in inventory. That is why this method matches the physical flow of the specific items sold and remaining in inventory to their actual cost. 39 Last In, First Out LIFO LIFO is allowed only under US GAAP. This method states that the newest goods purchased or manufactured are sold first and the oldest goods purchased or manufactured, including beginning inventory, remain in ending inventory. For example, the last units included in the inventory are assumed to be the first units sold from inventory. The cost of sales reflects the cost of goods purchased or manufactured more recently, and the value of closing inventory reflects the cost of older goods. In periods of increasing prices, the costs assigned to the units in ending inventory are lower than the costs assigned to the units sold. In periods of falling prices, the costs assigned to the units in ending inventory are higher than the costs assigned to the units sold. First In, First out FIFO FIFO assumes that the oldest goods purchased or manufactured are sold first and therefore the newest goods purchased or manufactured remain in ending inventory. In other words, the primary u included in the inventory are assumed to be the primary units sold from inventory. The cost of sales shows, the cost of goods in opening inventory plus the cost of items purchased or manufactured earliest in the accounting period, and the value of ending inventory reflect the prices of products purchased or manufactured more recently. In periods of increasing prices, the costs assigned to the units in ending inventory are higher than the costs assigned to the units sold. Whereas, in periods of falling prices, the prices assigned to the units in ending inventory are less than the prices assigned to the units sold. Weighted Average Cost Weighted average cost, it assigns the average cost of the goods which are ready for a sale Opening inventory plus purchase, production, and other costs during the accounting period to the units that are sold and also the units in ending inventory. In an accounting period, the weighted average cost per unit is calculated by the total cost of 40the units readyavailable for sale divided by the total number of units ready for sale in the period Total cost of goods available for saleTotal units available for sale. Weighted Average Cost vs. FIFO vs. LIFO examples Example Suppose you have a furniture store and you purchase 400 tables for $10 per unit. The next month, you buy another 600 tables for $20 per unit. At the end of an accounting period, lets assume you sold 200 total tables. The application of the weighted average costs, using both FIFO and LIFO are as follows 400 tables at $10 per tables $4,000. 600 tables at $20 per tables $12,000 Total number of tables 1,000 Weighted Average Cost Cost of a tables $16,000 divided by 1,000 $16tables Cost of Goods Sold $16 x 200 $3,200 Remaining Inventory $16 x 800 $12,800 First In, First out Cost Cost of goods sold 200 tables sold x $10 $2,000. Remaining Inventory 200 tables x $10 600 tables x $20 $14,000 Last In, First Out Cost Cost of goods sold 200 tables sold x $20 $4,000 Remaining Inventory 400 tables x $10 400 tables x $20 $12,000 41Measuring and Reporting of LongLived Assets BY SADHIKA NIMBUTKAR"
What are the longlived assets?,"Longlived assets are assets that are expected to provide economic benefits over a future period of time, typically greater than one year. Longlived assets are also referred to as noncurrent assets or longterm assets. Longlived assets may be tangible or intangible. Examples property, plant, equipment, land, buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, furniture fixtures."
What are tangible and intangible assets?,"Tangible assets Tangible assets are physical assets with a clear purchase value that are used by a business to produce goods and services. They are also known as hard assets. Examples plant, property, equipment, etc. physical items Intangible assets Intangible assets are assets lacking physical substance. Under IFRS, identifiable intangible assets must meet three definitional criteria. They must be 1 identifiable, 2 under the control of the company, and 3 expected to generate future economic benefits. In addition, two recognition criteria must be met 1 It is probable that the expected future economic benefits of the asset will flow to the company, and 2 the cost of the asset can be reliably measured. Goodwill, which is not considered an identifiable intangible asset, arises when one company purchases another and the acquisition price exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable assets. Examples patents, trademarks, copyrights, etc."
"Why do firms revalue property, plant, and equipment?","Property, plant, and equipment are tangible fixed assets that are held by an organization and are used in the production or supply of goods services to others. These assets are used frequently which helps to produce goods or services that in turn generate revenue or profit for the firm. Due to the continuous use of plants and equipment, it may incur some expenses due to wear and tear. Therefore, it may depreciate in value. Also due to continuous and high inflation, there is a difference between the historical cost and current market value of the assets. This gap between historical cost and current market value of the assets makes it necessary for a firm to revalue the assets. As it may appreciate or depreciate. So, the value does not remain the same and therefore the firms have to revalue the property, plant, and equipment in order to know the true value of the same. A firm may revalue its assets with the aim of lifting its stock price by informing investors of its current value. A rise in the stock price would make a company a less attractive takeover target."
Why is the useful life of an asset often less than its physical life?,"The useful life of an asset is the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use. Physical life is the period of time that an asset remains functional. The useful life of an asset often less than its physical life because of the following factors New technology in the market results in suppression of the assets currently in use. Changes in product markets may make an asset outdated. New regulation given by regulators specifies limits on assets lives for environmental and safety reasons. Contractual terms constrain the use of an asset. Companies voluntarily replace assets on safety and operating cost consideration. For example, a computers useful life is approximately 4 years or less while the physical life is 40 years. However, this is because newer and more efficient computers with high technology will cause companies to replace computers before the end of their physical life."
What does depreciation mean?,"Concept of Depreciation In the process of revenue generation, we consume or use the economic potential of longterm assets. After some time, these assets will become useless and then they are disposed of or replaced. The economic potential so consumed represents the expired cost of these assets and they must be recovered from the revenue of the business in order to determine the income earned by the business. Therefore, for this purpose depreciation is used. The term depreciation is used only in the case of fixed assets or longterm assets. For example Suppose we have a Tours Transportation business for which we purchase a new car for a particular value say 10,00,000. So, now after 5 years, you want to sell it. But you will not be able to sell it at the same price at which you bought. This is because the value of the car decreases as a car requires maintenance due to wear and tear say 10,000 each year. Thus, the value of the car got reduced or depreciated by 10,000 at the end oeach year. This concept is called Depreciation and the value is said to be depreciated. In accounting, depreciation is used to denote a decrease in the book value of fixed assets. A company or an organization doesnt pay the depreciation amount to the outsider rather it is been paid to the company itself and is treated as an Internal expense of a company."
Is land depreciated? Why or Why not?,"No, the Land is not depreciated as its use is considered indefinite For example Imagine there was a small piece of land and there was a small fishing village on it. It was surrounded by green trees all around. But after some time, these trees were cut for farming. Over a period of time due to electricity coalbased thermal power plants were set up. On the same piece of land, new houses can be built. Thus, a single piece of land can have multiple uses and can be used for multiple years, unlike other assets. Therefore, it can be concluded that land is not depreciated. because the land is assumed to have an unlimited useful life."
What two popular methods of Depreciation?,"METHODS OF DEPRECIATION WRITTEN STRAIGHT LINE DOWN VALUE METHOD SLM METHOD RDVM STRAIGHT LINE METHOD SLM SLM is the most popular method because of its simplicity and consistency. This method is also called as Equal Instalment Method or Fixed Percentage or Original Cost Method. In this method, the fixed amount of the original cost is charged as depreciation every year. Formula Depreciation SLM Original cost of Fixed Asset Installation charges Estimated Scrap Value Useful life of the Asset For example Suppose ABC company ltd purchased a secondhand machine for rupees 80,000 and spent 20,000 on its repairs and installation. The scrap value is 40,000. The useful life is 4 years. Calculate depreciation through SLM. Depreciation 80,000 20,000 40,0004 15000 Therefore, the depreciation charged at the end of every year is Rs 15,000. 45Characteristics The method is simple to understand and to apply. Under this method, the value of the asset can be reduced to zero. This method does not take into account the effective utilization of the assets. WRITTEN DOWN VALUE METHOD RDVM This method of charging depreciation is also known as Diminishing Balance Method or Reducing Balance Method. Here this method assumes that the rate of allocation should be constant through time. This method is the only method acceptable for tax purposes. In this method, the rate of depreciation remains constant whereas the amount of depreciation goes on decreasing. For example The ABC company purchased machinery at rupees 50,000. The company decided to charge depreciation on machinery at 10 per annum by the Written Down Value Method for 2 years. Cost Price A 50,000 Depreciation amount 50,00010 B 5,000 Value at the end of the 1st year ABC 45,000 Depreciation amount 45,00010 D 4,500 Value at the end of the 2nd year CDE 40,500 Characteristics The depreciation amount goes on decreasing year by year. The only method is acceptable for tax purposes. 46 Suitable for the assets that have a high rate of obsolescence."
What is Amortisation and Depletion?,"Amortisation is a decline in the value of intangible assets like goodwill, copyright, patent, etc. Amortisation is the term used for depreciation of intangible assets. Depletion is a gradual degradation of natural resources reserves. Depletion is the act of recovering the natural resources available, such as mining coal or pumping out of oil. It also means the allocation of the cost of a natural resource to the units extracted in the period. 47Measuring and Reporting of Income Tax BY MANAV JOSHI"
What is Tax?,"Tax is a sum of money that has to be paid to the government by an individual or an entity so that it can provide services to the publicresidentscitizensentities. Tax is a source of income for any government in order to run itself as well as provide services to its people and incur various public expenditures to ensure the growth and development of the country. There are two types of taxes. a Indirect Tax. Any tax or a fee charged by the government at the manufacturing level is an indirect tax. This tax is then added to the cost of goods or services provided by the manufacturer and then collected from the consumer. Since the burden of tax is shifted, the consumer is ultimately the bearer of the tax. For e.g. GST, Excise Duty, ExportImport Duty, etc. b Direct Tax. Direct taxes are taxes that an individual or an entity pays directly to the government. Unlike Indirect Tax, the tax burden is not shifted in Direct Tax. For e.g. Income Tax, Corporate Tax, Property Tax, etc."
What is the Income Tax?,"Income tax is a tax paid by individualscompanies according to the slab of earnings or gains during a financial year. It is a type of Direct Tax. In India, the Government of India decides the tax rates."
How do companies calculate their Income Tax?,"Companies calculate their tax liabilities based on the profit made by them from their businesses throughout a financial year. Companies calculate their tax liability on the basis of accounting profit, but they have to pay tax as per income tax laws, taking Taxable Profit as the base for calculation of tax payable."
What are Accounting Profit and Taxable Profit?,"Accounting Profit is the profit or loss for a given period incurred by the company before deducting income tax expense. It is calculated by applying accounting standards and principles determined by the company whereas Taxable profit is the profit or loss for a defined time which is determined with respect to the rules set up by the taxation authorities upon whom income tax is payable or recoverable. For e.g. Tax laws mandate the WDV method, while SLM is commonly used in accounting."
What is Tax expense?,"As defined in IND AS 12, Tax expense tax income is the aggregate amount included in the determination of profit or loss for the period in respect of current tax and deferred tax. In other words, Tax Expense is the amount of tax that is computed on accounting profit."
What is Current Tax?,"According to IND AS 12, Current tax is the amount of income taxes payable recoverable in respect of the taxable profit tax loss for a period. We can say that the current tax is the amount that a company or an individual is required to pay as income tax."
What are Advance Tax and Deferred Tax AssetLiability?,"When a part or whole of the Current Tax is paid before the end of the financial year 31st March, it is known as advanced tax. In this case, the Tax expense is estimated by the company and advance tax is paid accordingly.
