AVARICHY Mobile Application
This ZIP file contains the data, code, video, and presentation for our innovative solution Avarichy, a mobile application built to support financial operations. Developed with React Native for the frontend and Node.js (Express) with MongoDB for backend services, this application integrates with four fine-tuned AI models via Gemini 1.5 Flash APIs. The codebase implements the CRISP-DM methodology for data processing and includes Jupyter notebooks documenting data extraction and preprocessing pipelines in both English and Arabic, with additional support for speech capabilities using Hugging Face models.
